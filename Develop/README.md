# ecommerce-back-end

Challenge 13 - ORM

## Description

This is the back end to an e-commerce site. This uses MYSQL2, Sequelize, Express, and MYSQL database.

## Installation

you will need to download all files, use NPM install for dependencies. Log in to MYSQL and enter password. Then run the seeds. Then enter NPM Start in the command line.

## Motivation

My motivation for this project was to create a back end for a commerce page

## Learnings and Futue Developments

I learned that it is the most difficult to get the dependencies to execute and the server to connect on Insomnia. I was able to get NPM start to show that it was listening on port but could not get it to show up on Insomnia. I will need to keep working through this issue in the future to determine where the issue is with this.
